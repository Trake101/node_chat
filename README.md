Node Chat
=========

Node.JS chat that supports multiple rooms and switching between rooms.

Requirements
____________

This chat uses Node.JS so you obviously need that, it also uses MongoDB to store chat logs.

The following Node.JS modules are required:

*express
*socket.io
*curl
*mongoose
*forever

Installation
____________

Pretty straight forward, just place the two files in the directory you wish to run it from.

You will need to make some changes in the code, in chat.html you will need to set the url for the chat and your desired port you want it to run over.  You will also need to update app.js to set the port as well.  Also, make sure that port is set to allow traffic.

Usage
_____

	node app.js

	forever start app.js
